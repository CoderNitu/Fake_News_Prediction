# Fake_News_Prediction
This project is on Fake News Prediction using Machine learning with python.......
I have done this project on google colab , you can try in other id's also . If you want to try in google colab you can directly excess trough my file.
I have uploaded a dataset. You can use mine or use other dataset which you  can download at www.kaggle.com.
In this project we use Logistic Regression Model, you can use other model as well
We basically train the model with the dataset we use and then check the accuracy score and at last make a prediction system which can tell whether a new is real or fake by using the label of the data where 0 means fake news and 1 means real news.
