# Fake_News_Prediction
This project is on Fake News Prediction using Machine learning with Python.......
I have done this project on google colab, you can try it on other sites also. If you want to try in Google Colab you can directly access it through my file.
I have uploaded a dataset. You can use mine or other datasets which you can download at www.kaggle.com.
In this project we use the Logistic Regression Model, you can use another model as well
I train the model with the dataset I use, then check the accuracy score, and at last make a prediction system that can tell whether news is real or fake by using the label of the data where 0 means fake news and 1 means real news.
